## About
A fun and responsive Body Mass Index (BMI) Calculator built using React, Vite, and Tailwind CSS.
Users can input their age, height, and weight to calculate their BMI, view their result category — Underweight, Normal, Overweight, or Obese — and receive a light-hearted message with a fun emoji or icon to make the experience more engaging and enjoyable.
